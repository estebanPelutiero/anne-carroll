    "titleAbout": "About me",
    "content": "I'm Anne Carroll, also known as Pachu! I'm an image consultant and fashion stylist, and I love helping people express themselves through their style. I trained at FIT in New York (Fashion Institute of Technology), one of the most well-known fashion schools in the world, which gave me the great opportunity to work at New York Fashion Week! This was the perfect opportunity for me to dedicate myself to what I am so passionate about: sharing my knowledge with clients, fashion brands and different companies that trust me every day. Both certifications allowed me to find a balance between a more scheduled work, in my role as image consultant, and the infinite freedom to create and play with clothes and colors, as a stylist. Each stage in our lives, each completed cycle, are always accompanied by a change in our image. As we go through life, our needs and desires change, and so does our image. It's natural! We're constantly evolving, and our image should reflect that. I've learned so much about myself and how to communicate non-verbally. I'm so grateful for all the opportunities I've had to grow and evolve. I truly believe that everyone should have the chance to do the same."

      "quote": "Excellent! I learned to make combinations that I never imagined, to use things that had been untouched for months. I feel like this is an exercise that needs to be done at least twice a year because otherwise, I stagnate in my daily life. Additionally, I learned some things about the clothes that suit me and what doesn't, which I didn't know before. And all with a lot of love, starting from the base that Ani lets everyone decide what to wear and how, she advises from knowledge and guides you."

Another incredible experience, which gave me a lot of information about myself, the color palette that best suits me, taking into account all the factors that characterize me, among other things. It was highly revealing, distinguishing details about my image that I had not noticed before, and getting very practical and easy to apply tips. I invite you to take this service, you will certainly not regret it."

      "quote": "If there is something I admire about Pachu is her special eye for discovering unique garments in any store. I don't know how, but she discovers “that” blouse, blazer or pants that you wouldn't have detected. Make no doubt about it, when she tells you: 'play with this garment, it will lift your outfit', DON'T DOUBT IT. Whether it's the color, the cut, the style... that garment is going to stand out and it's going to stand out to you every time you wear it. This fascinates me and is something I am completely incapable of doing on my own."

In these sessions, I learned the importance of making choices, understanding who I was and who I want to be to make room for the new. We did a wardrobe detox, and she was my personal shopper with prior research and creativity."

It started with a Zoom call where she got to know me, which I thought would last 15 minutes, but we spent an hour defining the goals of the work. When she came to my house, she not only helped me discard 70% of my closet that was in bad condition but also eliminated items that didn't align with what I had declared I wanted to achieve."

Contrary to my initial thoughts, it provided me with new tools while confirming my classic style."
